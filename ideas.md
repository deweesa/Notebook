# Tech I want to try out
 - Docker
 - React Native
 - MongoDB (or something SQLess)

# Ideas
 - Movie list
    - Create a simple web app hosted somewhere so when Nadia/I think of a movie to watch we can put it there
    - Simple MERN stack app, probably hosted on my PI or on AWS
    - Could try react native on this one so it could be used as either a web app or android app
 - Chess.com clone
    - working on this one with matt, working on simple one page chess game then expand to online play w/leaderboards
